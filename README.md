# Hi there, I'm Pavel Luhckov ðŸ‘‹

I'm an AI Engineer and Mobile Developer passionate about building the next generation of intelligent applications.

### ðŸš€ Currently Working On:

**Caliinda** â€” A smart calendar Android app powered by a dynamic, multi-agent AI system. I'm moving beyond simple "AI chatbots" to create a truly proactive and adaptive user experience.

-   **ðŸ¤– Backend & AI:** Python, Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
-   **ðŸ“± Frontend:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose

The goal is to build a system where the AI isn't just a feature, but the core of the application's logic.

### ðŸ“š Sharing My Journey:

I'm also documenting my process of building complex AI systems in my guide: **[Building Intelligent Systems: A Modern Playbook](https://github.com/PaveLuchkov/AIasProduct)**. I explore patterns for creating reliable, scalable, and non-hallucinating AI agents.
